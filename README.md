# LoquendoTTS
VB6 Wrapper for the Loquendo API

Using VB6, I have quickly put together a command line client which allows the use of all the features of Loquendo TTS API.
The reason for using VB was that it allows easy interfacing with the API through the use of an Active X Library.

Usage
HelloTTS.vbp can be imported into Visual Basic 6 and the recompiled to suit your needs.

There is a compiled version HelloTTS.exe which is using Allison's voice.
